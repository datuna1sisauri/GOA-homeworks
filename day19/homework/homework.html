            <h2>laws in football</h2>
            <p>The game of association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886.</p>
            <p>The game is played with a football that is <b>68-70 cm (27-28 in)</b> in circumference. The two teams compete to score goals by getting the ball into the other team's goal</p>
            <p>When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may also use any other <u>part of their body</u>, such as</p>
            <ul>
            <li>head</li>
            <li>shoudler</li>
            <li>chest</li>
            </ul>
            <p>to make long story short they can use all part of their body but can not use hands and arms</p>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <p id="#5">Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and that only within the penalty area</p>
            <aside><img src="image.png" alt="goalkeeper" width="250"></aside>
            <p>The team that has <u>scored more goals</u> at the end of the game is the winner. </p>
            <p>here are situations where a goal can be disallowed, such as an offside call or a foul in the build-up to the goal.</p>
            <p>Depending on the format of the competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being declared with 1 point awarded to each team,<br> or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shoot-out.</p>
